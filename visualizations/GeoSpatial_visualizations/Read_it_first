Folium maps use interactive Leaflet.js-based HTML, and GitHub renders .ipynb notebooks as static previews using their own renderer. That means:

Interactive outputs (like Folium maps) donâ€™t render on GitHub.

Only static outputs (like printed text, matplotlib plots) are visible.

so, Try run the code on ur PC then get the output :)
